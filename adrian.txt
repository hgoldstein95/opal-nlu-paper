Where do I talk about the fact that lookup needs a way to choose between
multiple entities of the same type/the limitation that a type only include each
entitiy once?

Have you gotten anywhere with examples? I'm trying to figure out what exactly I
should cover in the evaluation.

What should the conclusion say? I'm a little stuck.
