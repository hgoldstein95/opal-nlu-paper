Typed Interactions for NLU in Opal

Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is a machine learning technique designed to
extract meaning from human language, and it is becoming increasingly prevalent
when writing applications like chat bots and personal assistants. While NLU
libraries are becoming more and more powerful, they are often cumbersome to
configure and provide little to no type safety.

This work contributes tools for interacting with NLU libraries, and adds them to
the Opal programming languge and ecosystem. It revolves around a simple DSL for
simultaneously writing program types and NLU configuration, providing a
type-safe way to interact with the NLU backend.
